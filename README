Hello,
this is my first community program and you have to use it at your own risk, because its not finished and I'm not responsable
in any way to what could happen to YOU using this ! So BE WARNED !!

What it should do:

1) It downloads Trinity Core Tarball
2) Uncompresses it
3) Builds the database downloading/uncompressing the last big world db and creating the rest

It lacks a settings window !! So you have to set all your settings using Visual C# Express or Mono Develop

I hope that someone helps me to finish it 
Thank you
